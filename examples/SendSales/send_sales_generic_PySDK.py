"""Generates a tax file for each zip code.

This script calls the AvaTax API to pull a list of all zip codes
with addresses and creates locations based on that list.
Then it generates a tax file based on the locations and given
list of tax codes.

Writing the files requires a folder named "taxfiles" to be
created prior to running this script.
